crypt_perm
==========

C++ library that represents new encryption method. It uses permutations to encrypt or decrypt some data.
I've added pretty simple example of encoder that uses mentioned library. 
Examle: source file - text.txt, encoded file - encoded.txt, permutation - 13562487
$ ./encoder text.txt encoded.txt 13562487
